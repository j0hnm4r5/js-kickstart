# js-kickstart

This project gets you started using a modern JS workflow as quickly and easily as possible. It uses Parcel for a dev server, transpilation, and bundling, has an option to use React, and comes with built-in Websocket communication between the client and node. Additionally, it uses Prettier and ESLint to keep your code formatted and error-free.

## Installation

`npm install && npm run kickstart`

Follow the prompts on the screen, and then wait until the script has finished.

## Usage
